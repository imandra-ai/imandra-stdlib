(* Distinct model sequences in userland in Imandra *)

(* Multiple models as an object-level IML query.
   Note this does not enforce that models are distinct,
   but they often are in practice and this non-enforcement
   of distinctness makes it extremely cheap. *)

(* We can use a functional argument and point-wise
   functional constraints to `force' distinctness.
   This is exploiting congruence closure and functionality
   (the axioms of "being a function") in a cool (and cheap!) way.
